## here it is

the basic search engine we were tasked with making.
<br>
<br>

## the files

- a python file with all code
- three .txt files
- a .zip file containing all 4 relevant files

<br>
<br>

## how it works

### the idea is simple
- simply run the python file (with the .txt files in the same folder)
- write the word or phrase you want to search for in the files
- look at the results

this could probably have gotten a cleaner design if i had time, something i sorely lack as of writing this line

<br>
<br>

## the conclusion

### first of, this isn't a research paper, so conclusion is uneccesary

second, it was a good experience to learn a bit about how to work with external files in python. \
i am not too great with that so it was a good project to get. \
there are a few things i could've done better if i had more time and knowledge, as well as less things happening during the week. \
but eh, i'm happy with what i made
